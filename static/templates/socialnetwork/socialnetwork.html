			This section will address the social network of soccer players. It will explain the structure of the network and a brief description of each network analyse.
		</p>
		<p>
			The network consists of the soccer players and links between them if they have played together in their careers. This makes it possible to investigate the impact of the soccer players on the network and their relations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The following attributes describes the nodes and links in the network:
		</p>
		<strong>Nodes:</strong> Soccer players
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Attribute:</strong> Name</li>
			<li><strong>Attribute:</strong> Age</li>
			<li><strong>Attribute:</strong> Current Team</li>
			<li><strong>Attribute:</strong> Market Value</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Links:</strong> A link is established between two soccer players if they have played on the same team
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Attribute:</strong> Team</li>
		</ul>
