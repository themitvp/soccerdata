		<h3>What does the Degree Distribution show?</h3>
		<p>
			The histogram shows that there exists some hubs in the network. Soccer players with a low degree is more frequent than soccer players with a high degree. This means that many soccer players have only played together with 0-100 other players. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In a similar study for NBA, <a href="http://ise.tamu.edu/people/faculty/butenko/papers/nba_graph.pdf">Social Networks in Sports</a>, it was revealed that the players with the highest degree (number of links) were actually players sitting on the bench. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, it was investigated whether the same pattern occured in the soccer player network. The result below in the table shows the top 10 players with the highest degree.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is interesting to see that the soccer players are actually <strong>not</strong> well known, which points at the same conclusion as the NBA Study. Further investigation (follow the wiki links) revealed that the players are mostly sitting on the bench or switching between many clubs. They never really perform greatly, so that could be the answer to why they have a high degree.
