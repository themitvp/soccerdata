			It will be interesting to see what types of communities there exists in a soccer player network. As the world is getting more globalized, there is a  higher diversity of nationalities among the countries.
		</p>
		<p>
			This section will investigated if the same tendency occurs in the soccer player network. This should result in communities with a diverse group of nationalities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The modularity was calculated to examine how good the network is divided into communities.
		</p>
		<p>
			With a modularity of <strong>0.7</strong>, there is a strong indicator that there exist communities in the network.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>22</strong> communities were found and are displayed in the graph below:

			A color represents a community. The communities overlap to a certain extent, reflected by not being completely separated.
		</p>
		<p>
			For further investigation, the nodes are kept in their position but the colors now represents countries. The graph below then reflects if the countries correspond to the communities.
