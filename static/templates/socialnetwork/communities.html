			Given that the world is becoming increasingly globalized, higher levels of ethnic diversity become observable within different countries. Hence, an examination of the various types of communities that exist within a soccer player network proves to be particularly intriguing.
		</p>
		<p>
			This section will investigate whether the same tendency for diversity occurs within the soccer player network. The findings are expected to point to communities of high ethnic diversity.
		</p>
		<p>
			The modularity was calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of the networkâ€™s division into communities. 
		</p>
		<p>
			With a modularity of <strong>0.7</strong>, there is a strong indicator that communities do exist within the network.
		</p>
		<p>
			Specifically, <strong>22</strong> communities were identified, as is shown in the graph below:
		</p>
		<img class="img-responsive center-block"  src="static/images/communities.png">
		<p>
			Each color represents a different community. At some points, communities are shown as not completely separated, as they often overlap to a certain extent.
		</p>
		<p>
			To allow further examinations, the nodes remain fixed in their position but the colors now stand for different countries. The graph below thus reflects whether countries correspond to communities.

			The table below was designed to facilitate more in-depth analysis. It illustrates the correspondence between communities and nationalities. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The following conclusions can be drawn from this table: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Community 1:</strong> Mainly Cyprus and Greece.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Community 2:</strong> Mainly Czech Republic and Slovakia.</li>

			<li><strong>Community 3:</strong> Mainly Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro.</li>
