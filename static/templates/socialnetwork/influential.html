			To find the soccer players with the most influence on the network, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality">betweenness centrality</a> was calculated for each player.
		</p>
		<p>
			The result is shown in the table below. Note that the centrality is low, this means that there are no particular central players in the network. If the result had been closer to 1, then it would have reflected a network with stronger central hubs.

			If you want a soccer player on your team who has impact on the soccer network, pick one of these guys:
